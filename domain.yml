He has been severely depressed his entire life and has tried to commit suicide on several occasions. He has pleaded with the social media companies to get this under control but his requests were met by other users with more hate speech. He now doesn’t use social media for his health."

  utter_hateful_speech_Q:

  utter_struggling:
  - text: "Jerry is a struggling comedian. He loves to make people laugh and unite them. He likes to make risky jokes, jokes about himself and treats comedy as a cathartic experience.

One such time he got in trouble for joking about a serious topic and now he cannot find a venue to do the thing he loves."

  - text: "People like Sally expose corruption, and allow the citizens to be informed about the people they elected. Should we really limit her?"
