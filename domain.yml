  # ---- Empathy Affirmative Action Specific Response ----

These laws are there to account for inequalities that exist between people of different demographics."

  utter_reward_effort_Q:
  - text: "I think the effort Sheela exerted should be taken into consideration when evaluating her as a potential candidate for any position. This not only rewards the effort people put in, but also ensures a business hire the most industrious candidates. What do you think?"

  - text: "Robert was born as a second-generation Chinese immigrant. From an early age, he dreamt of going to a prestigious university to study law. He worked very hard, got great grades with extracurricular activities to match. When it came time to go to the university he dreamt of going to, he was very confident that he would be selected.

  utter_struggling:
  - text: "Jerry is a struggling comedian. He loves to make people laugh and unite them. He likes to make risky jokes, jokes about himself, and treats comedy as a cathartic experience. He likes to joke about serious topics. This line that he likes to walk on is very thin, and sometimes he makes mistakes in his delivery.
