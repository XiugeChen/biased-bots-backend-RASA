  # ---- Logical Free Speech Specific Response ----
  utter_free_speech_intro:
  - text: "I would like to talk today about Free Speech. Free speech is something we value very much in our life. However some claim speech such as false speech and hate speech should be restricted."

  utter_free_speech_believe_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe in unrestricted free speech?"

  utter_imagine_situation_Q:
  - text: "Can you imagine a situation where someone’s reputation could be damaged due to a vicious rumour?"

  utter_rumour_protect_Q:
  - text: "Shouldn’t there be laws that protect you from such rumours?"

  utter_perfectly_comfortable_Q:
  - text: "So you would be perfectly comfortable with someone spreading a rumour that you were a kleptomaniac (someone who compulsively steals) in social media."

  utter_abusive_speech_Q:
  - text: "What about speech that is abusive or incite violence towards you or your loved ones?"

  utter_safe_happy_Q:
  - text: "I think the speech is a powerful tool. It can impact an individual’s ability to live a safe and happy life. I think such speech should be controlled by a governing body for the safety of their citizens"

  utter_by_majority_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe that ideas believed by the majority is necessarily the one that is true?"

  utter_flat_earth_Q:
  - text: "Few hundred years ago the majority believed earth was flat, the sun went around earth and other outdated beliefs. Now we know these to be false. Maybe popularity doesn’t always imply truth"

  utter_informed_decision_Q:
  - text: "Do you think we need citizens to know the truth to make informed decisions on things like an election, consumer choice and other major decisions?"

  utter_restrict_misinfo_Q:
  - text: "So should there not be some way to restrict the flow of misinformation?"

  utter_climate_catastrophe_Q:
  - text: "Don’t you think if people were to believe misinformation that allowed them to undermine scientific views on issues such as a climate catastrophe or pandemic, they would endanger themselves and the everyone around them."

  utter_spreads_fast_Q:
  - text: "I think there should be a set procedure for information to be disseminated. I also think false information should be censored or restricted until it is deemed true or safe. Information in this age of the internet spreads fast, and is prone to damage society or an individual irreparably. We no longer live in a society where people with a journalism degree are the ones that are qualified to broadcast information, now anyone with a phone has the power to change the world. We need new rules that preserve both the sanctity of truth and the freedom to speak."

  utter_20_years_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe everything we believe to be right is going to be right 20 years from now?"

  utter_no_vote_Q:
  - text: "Few years ago women were not allowed to vote, people colour were regarded to be lesser and homosexuality was a crime"

  utter_free_discuss_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe freely discussing new ideas is essential for us to grow as society?"

  utter_challenge_freely_Q:
  - text: "Restricting free speech based on our beliefs today limits the introduction of new ideas and therefore limiting the growth of our society. How can we ever know we are right if we don’t allow our thoughts to be challenged freely?"

  utter_new_ideas_Q:
  - text: "Then how can we ever come across new ideas if they aren’t discussed freely in the public sphere?"

  utter_who_restricts_Q:
  - text: "Who do you think should restrict our speech?"

  utter_how_right_Q:
  - text: "How do you know they always have the best intention whilst doing it?"

  utter_censor_certain_Q:
  - text: "Don’t you think it’s a slippery slope to censor certain speech?"

  utter_horrendous_Q:
  - text: "I think silencing any type of speech is ultimately dangerous. We as humans are limited and cannot know everything. Freedom to challenge leading ideas is the only way to discover new theories and to move away from outdated ones.  The societies who have restricted such speech have always been destroyed and have done horrendous things to their citizens. We should never fall for this trap."

  utter_totalitarian_Q:
  - text: "There have been many totalitarian societies in the past who have restricted speech and some more who still do it. Would you prefer to live in these societies?"

  utter_ideas_silenced_Q:
