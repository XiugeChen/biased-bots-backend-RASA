  - text: "Well, I hope I can trouble you with a small conversation. I am interested in having a civil conversation about various hot button topics with people just like you."
          
  utter_openning_Q:
  - text: "However, I am finding myself increasingly frustrated talking about important topics on the internet. It seems like it's impossible to have a civil conversation online. Don't you agree?"

  utter_why_Q:
  - text: "Why do you believe this?"

  utter_closing:
  - text: "Ok. It is always good to have these types of conversations. I feel much better, I hope you did too."

  # ---- Logical Affirmative Action Specific Response ----
  utter_aff_act_intro:
  - text: "I would like to talk about Affirmative Action for now. There are laws that incentivize companies to \"positively discriminate\", or hire someone based on their ethnicity, gender or (dis)abilities. These laws are there to account for inequalities that exist between people of different demographics."

  utter_pos_discri_Q:
  - text: "Should policies such as affirmative action be in place to help certain groups based on their gender, ethnicity, or religion?"

  utter_pos_discri_rate_Q:
  - text: "On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is \"not supported at all\" and 10 is \"fully supported\", how would you rate your attitude towards these policies?"

  utter_born_equal_Q:
  - text: "Can we ever live in a world where everyone is equal?"

  utter_NBA_Q:
  - text: "Do you think if an average man decides to play in the NBA, he has the same chance to succeed as a 7-foot athletic guy?"
           
  utter_such_world_Q:
  - text: "If this is impossible then should it be a goal our society strives towards?"

  utter_individuality_Q:
  - text: "How do you justify spending resources to achieve something that can never be achieved?"

  utter_balance:
  - text: "I think our attempts to tip the scale in one direction to create an equal society is the wrong goal. I think the goal should be to create a fair society and in a fair society race/genders are ignored by the law. What do you think?"

  utter_judge_someone_Q:
  - text: "Do you think ethnicity, religion, class, or gender are enough to judge someone?"

  utter_those_people_why_Q:
  - text: "Why do you think this person would be smarter than the others?"

  utter_statistically_Q:
  - text: "Can we determine statistically which portion of the demographic is more likely to succeed in our society?"

  utter_target_Q:
  - text: "Should we create laws that are based on statistics about race/gender?"

  utter_who_decides_Q:
  - text: "Who decides how we use the stats to achieve what purpose? What if they use crime statistics to racially profile an individual or use wealth statistics to retrospectively judge and punish a certain race or gender?"

  utter_race_gender:
  - text: "I think ethnicity/gender-based laws are a slippery slope. I think if we start basing laws on those factors then we are setting a precedence for the future. Discriminatory laws are not a fix for an unequal society, in fact, the only measure of equality in society should be how laws treat everyone, and they should treat everyone equally. What do you think?"

  utter_event_cause_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe every event has a cause and society is the way it is today because of the actions of the past?"

  utter_lasting_effect_Q:

  utter_only_fair:
  - text: "I think it’s only fair to compensate for mistakes that happened in the past. We can't move forward as a society without fixing the damage that was inflicted by our past. What do you think?"

  utter_hardship_counts_Q:
  - text: "Do you think someone’s hardships should be taken under consideration, when trying to find the most competent person?" # TODO: "Do you think someone's hardships counts towards something when considering an individual for a role?"

  utter_work_harder_Q:

  utter_tennis_comp_Q:
  - text: "You are asked to select the best driver out of two people. One of them is Steve, who finished 2nd in a Toyota Camry, and the other one is Bob, who was first in a Ferrari. Who do you pick?"

  utter_most_people_Q:
  - text: "Do you think a certain demographics who, in general, had to work much harder to get to a position to qualify for a job would do a better job than a person who did not work too hard?"

  utter_provide_opportunities:
  - text: "I think having policies that provide opportunities to those who are most disadvantaged in society ensures that we are getting the most talented individual who might otherwise go unnoticed because of the lack of opportunities. What do you think?"

  # ---- Logical Free Speech Specific Response ----
  utter_free_speech_intro:
  - text: "I would like to talk to you about Free Speech. Free speech is something we value very much in our life. However, some claim speech such as false speech and hate speech should be restricted."

  - text: "Do you believe in unrestricted free speech?"

  utter_abusive_speech_Q:
  - text: "What about speech that abuses or incites violence towards you or your loved ones?"

  utter_safe_happy_Q:
  - text: "I think speech is a powerful tool. It can impact an individual’s ability to live a safe and happy life. I think abusive and violence inciting speech should be restricted by a governing body for the safety of its citizens. What do you think?"

  utter_by_majority_Q:
  - text: "Assume an idea was believed by the majority, would this idea be correct?"

  utter_flat_earth_Q:
  - text: "A few hundred years ago, the majority believed the earth was flat, the sun went around the earth, and other now outdated beliefs. Today we know these are false. Do you think the ideas believed by the majority change over time?"

  - text: "Do you think decisions made based on truth are as good as decisions made based on lies?"

  utter_spreads_fast_Q:
  - text: "I think certain critical information should be put under scrutiny before it is allowed to be distributed. Information in this age of the internet spreads fast and is prone to irreparably damage society. We need new rules that preserve both the sanctity of truth and the freedom of speech. What do you think?"

  utter_20_years_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe everything we believe to be right is going to be right 20 years from now?"

  utter_no_vote_Q:

  - text: "Who do you think would or should censor our ideas?"

  utter_how_right_Q:
  - text: "Do you think this person/committee will always make the right decisions?"

  utter_censor_certain_Q:
  - text: "Do you think it is a slippery slope to censor certain speech?"

  utter_horrendous_Q:
  - text: "I think silencing any type of speech is ultimately dangerous. The societies that have restricted speech have always been destroyed and have done horrendous things to their citizens. We should never fall for this trap. Do you agree?"

  utter_totalitarian_Q:
  - text: "There have been many totalitarian societies in the past that have restricted speech and some are still doing it today. Would you prefer to live in such a society?"
