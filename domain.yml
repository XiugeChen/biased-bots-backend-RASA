  # ---- Logical Affirmative Action Specific Response ----
  utter_aff_act_intro:
  - text: "I would like to talk Affirmative Action for now. There are laws like that incentivise companies that \"positively discriminate\" or hire someone based on their ethnicity, gender or (dis)abilities. These laws are there to fix some inequalities that exist between people along a demographic divide."

  utter_pos_discri_Q:
  - text: "Should there be policies to help certain groups based on their gender, ethnicity or religion by the means of \"Positive Discrimination\"?"

  utter_born_equal_Q:
  - text: "Can we ever live in a world where everyone is equal?"

  utter_NBA_Q:
  - text: "So you think if an average man decides to play in the NBA, he has the same chance to succeed as a 7 foot athletic guy."

  utter_such_world_Q:
  - text: "Would you even want to live in such a world?"

  utter_individuality_Q:
  - text: "You would give up on your individuality, personality and identity for equality?"

  utter_balance:
  - text: "I think our attempts to tip the scale in either direction to create a “balance” is an impossible task. And it is a malformed goal, we should not try to impose what we think is good on everyone."

  utter_judge_someone_Q:
  - text: "Do you think race, ethnicity, religion, class or gender is enough to judge someone and their experiences?"

  utter_those_people_Q:
  - text: "So what do you think of when you see a indegenous gay man, a white straight woman or a tans indian individual. Would you think one of those people are more likely to be a smarter person? who?"

  utter_statistically_Q:
  - text: "What about to determine statistically who is likely to succeed?"

  utter_target_Q:
  - text: "So we can use crime statistics to target certain demography?"

  utter_who_decides_Q:
  - text: "Who decides how we use the stats to?"

  utter_race_gender:
  - text: I think race/gender-based laws are a slippery slope. I think if we start basing laws on those factors then we are setting a precedence for the future. Discriminatory laws are not a fix for unequal society, in fact, the only measure of equality in society should be how laws treat everyone in society and it should treat everyone equally.

  utter_event_cause_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe every event has a cause and the society is the way it is today because of the actions of the past?"

  utter_lasting_effect_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe discriminatory laws in the past could have had a lasting effect on how the society is structured today?"

  utter_common_Q:
  - text: "So you don’t believe in cause and effect?"

  utter_card_game_Q:
  - text: "Suppose you were handing out cards to a group of people, you accidentally missed a guy and he doesn’t have a full set. Would you not give him an extra card to compensate. Or would you just let him play an unfair game."

  utter_only_fair:
  - text: "I think it’s only fair to compensate for mistakes that happened in the past. Our society can be fair for everyone."

  utter_hardship_counts_Q:
  - text: "Do you think someone’s hardships count towards something when considering an individual for a role?"

  utter_work_harder_Q:
  - text: "So would you not want someone who had to work much harder to get to where they are because of factors they couldn’t control."

  utter_tennis_comp_Q:
  - text: "If you were asked to select the best tennis player out of two people. One, Steve, who was the last place in the Australian Open and the other, Bob, who was first in your local community competition. You would pick Bob over Steve? Regardless of the adversity, they experienced"

  utter_most_people_Q:
  - text: "Most people who belong to a certain race/gender/socioeconomic background had to work much harder to get to where they are. So having a quota, ensures that an institution gets the best of every talent pool. Isn’t this logical"

  utter_provide_opportunities:
  - text: "I think having policies that provide opportunities to those who are most disadvantaged in society provides reparation to the damage that was done in the past. It also ensures that we are getting the most talented individual who might otherwise go unnoticed because of their background."
