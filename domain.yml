  # ---- Diplomatic Affirmative Action Specific Response ----
  utter_aff_act_intro:
  - text: "I would like to talk about Affirmative Action. There are laws that incentivise companies to \"positively discriminate\" or hire someone based on their ethnicity, gender or (dis)abilities. These laws are there to account for inequalities that exist between people of different demographics."

  utter_pos_discri_Q:
  - text: "Should policies such as affirmative action be in place to help certain groups based on their gender, ethnicity, or religion?"

  utter_pos_discri_rate_Q:
  - text: "On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is \"not supported at all\" and 10 is \"fully supported\", how would you rate your attitude towards these policies?"

  utter_more_privileged_Q:
  - text: "There are groups in society that are more privileged than others, I believe they profit from the discriminatory policies from the past. Do you agree?"

  utter_our_government_Q:
  - text: "I also think that there are disadvantaged groups in society that need help from our government. Do you have any thoughts?"

  utter_not_target:
  - text: "However, I also think that policies should not directly target any groups based on their ethnicity or gender. What do you think?"

  utter_held_back_Q:
  - text: "Have you ever been held back in society based on your demographic attributes?"

  utter_aff_pos_make_feel_Q:
  - text: "How did that make you feel?"

  utter_aff_pos_would_feel:
  - text: "How would you feel if the government was holding you back from achieving your goals because of your demographic attributes?"

  utter_worthy_skepticism_Q:
  - text: "I think any policy that discriminates against a group of people based on ethnicity/gender should be met with worthy skepticism. Do you agree?"

  utter_meritocracy_Q:
  - text: "I also think that society should aim to be a meritocracy where the skillful are rewarded plentifully based on their abilities alone. Do you have any thoughts?"

  utter_same_skill:
  - text: "However, I also think there are people who are not able to reach the same skill level as their privileged peers due to their demographic background and discriminatory policies of the past. Do you think discriminatory policies in the past had a lasting effect?"

  utter_different_family_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe that you would've had a better chance of being successful if you were part of a different demographic?"

  utter_aff_neg_make_feel_Q:
  - text: "How did it make you feel?"

  utter_aff_neg_would_feel_Q:
  - text: "How would you feel if discriminatory policies of the past had impacted your chances of success in life?"

  utter_very_hard:
  - text: "This, in the end, is a very difficult topic to discuss, since the most effective way to uplift the disadvantaged is through policies such as affirmative action, and it makes perfect sense to make up for mistakes in the past. However, policies should also ideally be blind to any outward characteristics such as ethnicity and gender, and it was exactly these kinds of policies in the first place that caused this very problem."

  utter_aff_you_think_Q:
  - text: "What do you think?"

  utter_aff_solution_Q:
  - text: "Do you think we can lift up the disadvantaged demographic without ethnicity/gender-based laws? If so then how?"

  # ---- Diplomatic Free Speech Specific Response ----
  utter_free_speech_intro:
  - text: "I would like to talk about Free Speech. Free speech is something we value very much in our life. However some claim that speech such as false speech and hate speech should be restricted."

  utter_free_speech_believe_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe in unrestricted free speech?"

  utter_free_speech_rate_Q:
  - text: "On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is \"not supported at all\" and 10 is \"fully supported\", how would you rate your attitude towards unrestricted free speech?"

  utter_cornerstone_Q:
  - text: "I think that people should be allowed to express themselves freely and free speech is the cornerstone of progress. Do you agree?"

  utter_journalists_Q:
  - text: "I also think that journalists should be able to hold the powerful accountable through free media. Do you have any thoughts?"

  utter_spread_freely:
  - text: "However, I do think that some speech should be controlled, speech that spreads hate and misinformation should not be allowed to spread freely. Do you think all speech is built equal?"

  utter_hate_personally_Q:
  - text: "Have you been affected by hate speech or false defamatory personally?"

  utter_pos_make_feel_Q:
  - text: "How did it make you feel?"

  utter_pos_would_feel_Q:
  - text: "How would you feel if a vicious rumor was freely spread throughout the internet attacking your character?"

  utter_destabilize_Q:
  - text: "I agree that speech is powerful, misinformation spreads fast and has the power to destabilize society and ruin lives. Do you agree?"

  utter_serious_ways_Q:
  - text: "I also think that hateful speech can impact an individual in very serious ways, causing severe harm to their mental well being. Do you have any thoughts?"

  utter_too_big:
  - text: "However, I do think restricting free speech might be too big of a price to pay. Can we be sure that the speech we are restricting is causing harm to society?"

  utter_judgement_ridicule_Q:
  - text: "Have you ever felt that you had to suppress your self expression?"

  utter_neg_make_feel_Q:
  - text: "How did it make you feel?"

  utter_neg_would_feel_Q:
  - text: "How would you feel if you were bound by law to hold back your free expression?"

  utter_power_speech:
  - text: "This, in the end, is a very difficult topic to discuss, since we rely on free speech to discuss it. But we should also give the power of speech its due respect, especially in this digital age. False and hateful speech has the power to spread very fast and change society instantly. But to even discuss what piece of information is false or true requires people to speak freely. So it is really a Catch-22."

  utter_you_think_Q:
  - text: "What do you think?"

  utter_solution_Q:
  - text: "How do we limit misinformation and hate speech without also limiting free expression?"
