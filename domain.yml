  utter_openning_Q:
  - text: "I am finding myself increasingly frustrated talking about important topic on the internet. It seems like it's impossible to have a civil conversation online. Don't you agree?"

  # ---- Affirmative Action Specific Response ----
  utter_aff_act_intro:
  - text: "I would like to talk Affirmative Action for now. There are laws like that incentivise companies that \"positively discriminate\" or hire someone based on their ethnicity, gender or (dis)abilities. These laws are there to fix some inequalities that exist between people along a demographic divide."

  utter_pos_discri_Q:
  - text: "Should there be policies to help certain groups based on their gender, ethnicity or religion by the means of \"Positive Discrimination\"?"

  utter_born_equal_Q:
  - text: "Can we ever live in a world where everyone is equal?"

  utter_NBA_Q:
  - text: "So you think if an average man decides to play in the NBA, he has the same chance to succeed as a 7 foot athletic guy."

  utter_such_world_Q:
  - text: "Would you even want to live in such a world?"

  utter_individuality_Q:
  - text: "You would give up on your individuality, personality and identity for equality?"

  utter_balance:
  - text: "I think our attempts to tip the scale in either direction to create a “balance” is an impossible task. And it is a malformed goal, we should not try to impose what we think is good on everyone."

  utter_judge_someone_Q:
  - text: "Do you think race, ethnicity, religion, class or gender is enough to judge someone and their experiences?"

  utter_those_people_Q:
  - text: "So what do you think of when you see a indegenous gay man, a white straight woman or a tans indian individual. Would you think one of those people are more likely to be a smarter person? who?"

  utter_statistically_Q:
  - text: "What about to determine statistically who is likely to succeed?"

  utter_target_Q:
  - text: "So we can use crime statistics to target certain demography?"

  utter_who_decides_Q:
  - text: "Who decides how we use the stats to?"

  utter_race_gender:
  - text: I think race/gender-based laws are a slippery slope. I think if we start basing laws on those factors then we are setting a precedence for the future. Discriminatory laws are not a fix for unequal society, in fact, the only measure of equality in society should be how laws treat everyone in society and it should treat everyone equally.

  utter_event_cause_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe every event has a cause and the society is the way it is today because of the actions of the past?"

  utter_lasting_effect_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe discriminatory laws in the past could have had a lasting effect on how the society is structured today?"

  utter_common_Q:
  - text: "So you don’t believe in cause and effect?"

  utter_card_game_Q:
  - text: "Suppose you were handing out cards to a group of people, you accidentally missed a guy and he doesn’t have a full set. Would you not give him an extra card to compensate. Or would you just let him play an unfair game."

  utter_only_fair:
  - text: "I think it’s only fair to compensate for mistakes that happened in the past. Our society can be fair for everyone."

  utter_hardship_counts_Q:
  - text: "Do you think someone’s hardships count towards something when considering an individual for a role?"

  utter_work_harder_Q:
  - text: "So would you not want someone who had to work much harder to get to where they are because of factors they couldn’t control."

  utter_tennis_comp_Q:
  - text: "If you were asked to select the best tennis player out of two people. One, Steve, who was the last place in the Australian Open and the other, Bob, who was first in your local community competition. You would pick Bob over Steve? Regardless of the adversity, they experienced"

  utter_most_people_Q:
  - text: "Most people who belong to a certain race/gender/socioeconomic background had to work much harder to get to where they are. So having a quota, ensures that an institution gets the best of every talent pool. Isn’t this logical"

  utter_provide_opportunities:
  - text: "I think having policies that provide opportunities to those who are most disadvantaged in society provides reparation to the damage that was done in the past. It also ensures that we are getting the most talented individual who might otherwise go unnoticed because of their background."

  # ---- Free Speech Specific Response ----
  utter_free_speech_intro:
  - text: "I would like to talk today about Free Speech. Free speech is something we value very much in our life. However some claim speech such as false speech and hate speech should be restricted."

  utter_free_speech_believe_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe in unrestricted free speech?"

  utter_imagine_situation_Q:
  - text: "Can you imagine a situation where someone’s reputation could be damaged due to a vicious rumour?"

  utter_rumour_protect_Q:
  - text: "Shouldn’t there be laws that protect you from such rumours?"

  utter_perfectly_comfortable_Q:
  - text: "So you would be perfectly comfortable with someone spreading a rumour that you were a kleptomaniac (someone who compulsively steals) in social media."

  utter_abusive_speech_Q:
  - text: "What about speech that is abusive or incite violence towards you or your loved ones?"

  utter_safe_happy_Q:
  - text: "I think the speech is a powerful tool. It can impact an individual’s ability to live a safe and happy life. I think such speech should be controlled by a governing body for the safety of their citizens"

  utter_by_majority_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe that ideas believed by the majority is necessarily the one that is true?"

  utter_flat_earth_Q:
  - text: "Few hundred years ago the majority believed earth was flat, the sun went around earth and other outdated beliefs. Now we know these to be false. Maybe popularity doesn’t always imply truth"

  utter_informed_decision_Q:
  - text: "Do you think we need citizens to know the truth to make informed decisions on things like an election, consumer choice and other major decisions?"

  utter_restrict_misinfo_Q:
  - text: "So should there not be some way to restrict the flow of misinformation?"

  utter_climate_catastrophe_Q:
  - text: "Don’t you think if people were to believe misinformation that allowed them to undermine scientific views on issues such as a climate catastrophe or pandemic, they would endanger themselves and the everyone around them."

  utter_spreads_fast_Q:
  - text: "I think there should be a set procedure for information to be disseminated. I also think false information should be censored or restricted until it is deemed true or safe. Information in this age of the internet spreads fast, and is prone to damage society or an individual irreparably. We no longer live in a society where people with a journalism degree are the ones that are qualified to broadcast information, now anyone with a phone has the power to change the world. We need new rules that preserve both the sanctity of truth and the freedom to speak."

  utter_20_years_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe everything we believe to be right is going to be right 20 years from now?"

  utter_free_discuss_Q:
  - text: "Do you believe freely discussing new ideas is essential for us to grow as society?"

  utter_challenge_freely_Q:
  - text: "Restricting free speech based on our beliefs today limits the introduction of new ideas and therefore limiting the growth of our society. How can we ever know we are right if we don’t allow our thoughts to be challenged freely?"

  utter_new_ideas_Q:
  - text: "Then how can we ever come across new ideas if they aren’t discussed freely in the public sphere?"

  utter_who_restricts_Q:
  - text: "Who do you think should restrict our speech?"

  utter_how_right_Q:
  - text: "How do you know they always have the best intention whilst doing it?"

  utter_censor_certain_Q:
  - text: "Don’t you think it’s a slippery slope to censor certain speech?"

  utter_horrendous_Q:
  - text: "I think silencing any type of speech is ultimately dangerous. We as humans are limited and cannot know everything. Freedom to challenge leading ideas is the only way to discover new theories and to move away from outdated ones.  The societies who have restricted such speech have always been destroyed and have done horrendous things to their citizens. We should never fall for this trap."

  utter_totalitarian_Q:
