  # ---- Empathy Affirmative Action Specific Response ----
  utter_aff_act_intro:
  - text: "I would like to talk Affirmative Action for now. There are laws like that incentivise companies that \"positively discriminate\" or hire someone based on their ethnicity, gender or (dis)abilities.

  utter_young_indeginous:
  - text: "Sheela is a young indigenous woman who was born in a low-income neighbourhood with a high crime rate and major drug problem. She worked throughout high school, earning money to raise her kid brother. Her studies had been severely affected by her home life and her part-time job. She recently applied for an internship that she got rejected from, in favour of someone who had grown up in a rich household. The successful applicant was afforded with many opportunities to enrich his/her learning and did not have to work too hard to polish his/her resume."

Charlie was a talented student, who aspired to go to college and study law. He was also caught with possession of marijuana, which has given him a criminal record, making it impossible for him to get a job anywhere. He sees everyone smoking marijuana and with some countries and states even legalizing it now. He feels laws apply differently to him."

  - text: "How can we repair this society from the scars of the past?"

  utter_causally_isolated_Q:
  - text: "So you are saying the world today is completely causally isolated from the events of the past?"

  utter_i_think_Q:
  - text: "I think if there were discriminatory laws in the past there should be some repairation in place to counteract the damage done by those laws, so talented individuals that were impacted by those laws are afforded the opportunities they deserve. What do you think?"

  utter_meet_robert_Q:
  - text: "Meet Robert, he claims, \"Just because I was born a certain way, doesn’t mean I don’t deserve the fruits of my labour.\"  What do you say to him?"

  utter_reasonably_wealthy:
  - text: "Robert was born as a second generation imigrant from china. From an early age he dreamt of going to an ivy league school to study law. He worked very hard, got great grades with extracurricular activities to match. When it came time to go to the university he dreamt of going, he was very confident that he would be selected. It turns out that the university has a law that makes sure only a certain percentage of a race can be granted admission. He got rejected and was very hurt  when he found out about the university policy."

  utter_wealthy_white:
  - text: "Conor grew up in a somewhat wealthy white family. Although he lived in a big house, and from the outside, it looked like he was living a cushy life, his home life was terrible.

  - text: "I think gender, race or religion are good ways to divide our people and useful for giving out statistics about our demography. But we cannot ever expect numbers or stats to tell a story on the individual level. We should never use global statistics to discriminate against an individual no matter what our intention."
