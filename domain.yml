  # ---- Empathy Affirmative Action Specific Response ----
  utter_aff_act_intro:
  - text: "I would like to talk about Affirmative Action. There are laws that incentivise companies to \"positively discriminate\" or hire someone based on their ethnicity, gender or (dis)abilities. These laws are there to account for inequalities that exist between people of different demographics."

  utter_pos_discri_Q:
  - text: "Do you think there should be policies to help certain groups based on their gender, ethnicity or religion by the means of \"Positive Discrimination\"?"

  utter_pos_discri_rate_Q:
  - text: "On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is not supported at all and 10 is fully supported, how would you rate your attitude towards these policies?"

  utter_meet_sheela_Q:
  - text: "Meet Sheela, she claims, \"There are people who have it a lot easier in life. People like me had to work much harder to get where we are now.\" What do you say to her?"

  utter_young_indeginous:
  - text: "Sheela is a young indigenous woman who was born in a low-income neighbourhood with a high crime rate and a major drug problem. She worked throughout high school, earning money to raise her kid brother. Her studies had been severely affected by her home life and her part-time job. She recently applied for an internship that she got rejected from, in favour of someone who had grown up in a rich household. The successful applicant was afforded with many opportunities to enrich their learning and did not have to work too hard to polish their resume."

  utter_experiences_Q:
  - text: "Do you think Sheela's life experiences count towards something when considering her for a role?"

  utter_hardship_Q:
  - text: "How can we account for this hardship?"

  utter_not_effort_Q:
  - text: "So are you saying we should not measure someone's success through how much effort they had to put in?"

  utter_reward_effort_Q:
  - text: "Should we not try and reward Sheela for the effort that she had to put in to be in the position she is now?"

  utter_meet_charlie_Q:
  - text: "Now let's meet Charlie, he claims \"The rulers don’t care about us. The world is rigged against us man!\" What do you say to him?"

  utter_black_man:
  - text: "Charlie is a black man who works as a warehouse packer. His dad died in prison after being wrongfully convicted for armed robbery. Charlie was a talented student, who aspired to go to college and study Law. He was also caught with possession of marijuana, which has given him a criminal record, making it impossible for him to get a job anywhere. He sees many people smoking marijuana and with some countries and states even legalizing it now, he feels laws apply differently to him."

  utter_discriminatory_laws_Q:
  - text: "Do you think that our discriminatory laws in the past had some effect on how society is structured today?"

  utter_how_repair_Q:
  - text: "How can we repair this society from the scars of the past?"

  utter_causally_isolated_Q:
  - text: "So you are saying the world today is completely causally isolated from the events of the past?"

  utter_i_think_Q:
  - text: "I think if there were discriminatory laws in the past there should be some reparation in place to counteract the damage done by those laws, so talented individuals that were impacted by those laws are afforded the opportunities they deserve. What do you think?"

  utter_meet_robert_Q:
  - text: "Meet Robert, he claims, \"Just because I was born a certain way, doesn’t mean I don’t deserve the fruits of my labour.\"  What do you say to him?"

  utter_reasonably_wealthy:
  - text: "Robert was born as a second generation immigrant from China. From an early age he dreamt of going to an ivy league school to study Law. He worked very hard, got great grades with extracurricular activities to match. When the time came to go to the university he dreamt of going, he was very confident that he would be selected. However, it turns out that the university policy makes sure that only a certain percentage of students of one ethnicity can be granted admission. He was rejected and was very hurt when he found out about this policy."

  utter_dreams_Q:
  - text: "Do you think Robert should miss out on his dreams, just because of the ethnicity he was born?"

  utter_less_qualified_Q:
  - text: "So you think someone less qualified should be admitted because of their ethnicity?"

  utter_eligibility_Q:
  - text: "What can be the measure of someone's eligibility, other than the actions they have taken in their lives?"

  utter_merit_Q:
  - text: "Shouldn't merit and merit alone be the measure for someone's ability?"

  utter_meet_conor_Q:
  - text: "Let's meet Conor then, he claims, \"I haven’t really benefited in my life because of me being a straight white man\". What do you say to him?"

  utter_wealthy_white:
  - text: "Conor grew up in a somewhat wealthy white family. Although he lived in a big house, and from the outside, it looked like he was living a cushy life, his home life was terrible. He had an abusive parent, who had mentally scarred him for life. His whole life he has been severely depressed and has tried to commit suicide on multiple occasions. And on many occasions, his plea for help has been seen as \"ungrateful\"."

  utter_judging_conor_Q:
  - text: "Do you think judging Conor based on his demographic attributes is fair to the experiences he had to deal with in his life?"

  utter_outwardly_Q:
  - text: "So you think it's fair for us to minimise one's entire life just to their outwardly appearances?"

  utter_criteria_Q:
  - text: "On what criteria should we judge someone's life?"

  utter_complexities_Q:
  - text: "Can we ever begin to comprehend the complexities that make an individual who they are?"

  utter_statistics:
  - text: "I think gender, ethnicity or religion are good ways to divide people and are useful for giving out statistics about demography. But we cannot ever expect numbers or stats to tell a story on the individual level. We should never use global statistics to discriminate against an individual no matter our intention. What do you think?"

  # ---- Empathy Free Speech Specific Response ----
  utter_free_speech_intro:
  - text: "I would like to talk about Free Speech. Free speech is something we value very much in our life. However some claim that speech such as false speech and hate speech should be restricted."

  - text: "Do you believe in unrestricted free speech?"

  utter_free_speech_rate_Q:
  - text: "On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is \"not supported at all\" and 10 is \"fully supported\", how would you rate your attitude towards unrestricted free speech?"

  utter_meet_larry_Q:
  - text: "Meet Larry, he claims, \"I think people online are so hateful. What is social media doing to protect its users?\" What do you say to Larry?"

  utter_meet_jerry_Q:
  - text: "Meet Jerry, he claims, \"It's comedy it should not be stopped, jokes are a reminder to detach our ideas from our identity.\" What do you say to him?"

  utter_cyberbullies:
  - text: "Larry was the victim of cyberbullies when he was in high school. There were jokes on his expense and when he retaliated he was exposed to hate speech regarding his sexual orientation. He has been severely depressed his entire life and has tried to commit suicide on several occasions. He has pleaded with the social media companies to get this under control but his requests were met by other users with more hate speech. He now doesn’t use social media to protect his health."

  utter_hateful_speech_Q:
  - text: "Don't you think Larry should be able to use social media without being exposed to hateful speech?"

  utter_abuse_hate_Q:
  - text: "Should we protect people like Larry so they can live a life free from abuse and hate?"

  utter_attacking_you_Q:
  - text: "So would you be comfortable with people attacking you for your ethnicity, gender or lifestyle, inciting violence against you, calling you names, and limiting your access to the internet?"

  utter_endangers:
  - text: "I think bullying endangers people's well being and the government should try and protect their citizens against such speech. Do you agree?"

  utter_meet_emily_Q:
  - text: "Let's meet Emily then, she claims, \"Truth is the truth. I have spent my life's work studying this. This misinformation campaign should be silenced\". What do you say to her?"

  utter_a_scientist:
  - text: "Emily is a scientist who has been researching the climate her entire life. She has discovered a major incoming climate catastrophe caused by human activity. There has been a campaign to spread disinformation throughout the media, discrediting her work. She feels very frustrated and worried."

  utter_more_credible_Q:

  utter_dissemination_Q:

  utter_barry_Q:
  - text: "So medical opinion from a doctor holds the same level of validity as your neighbour Barry's?"

  utter_powerful_information:
  - text: "I think information is very powerful. It can influence people and therefore society. Hateful speech and disinformation can do severe damage to the world. We should not treat all speech equally but favour some over others. What do you think?"

  utter_struggling:
  - text: "Jerry is a struggling comedian. He loves to make people laugh and unite them. He likes to make risky jokes, jokes about himself and treats comedy as a cathartic experience. He likes to joke about serious topics and make people laugh. This line that he likes to walk on is very thin and sometimes he makes mistakes in his delivery. One such time he got in trouble for joking about a serious topic and now he cannot find a venue anymore to do the thing he loves."

  utter_silenced_Q:
  - text: "Words don't physically hurt anyone and Jerry's intentions were pure, should Jerry really be silenced for mere words?"

  u_agree_with_Q:
  - text: "So you think anyone whose opinions or words you don’t agree with or makes you feel uncomfortable should be silenced?"

  u_censor_artists_Q:
  - text: "Don't you really think censoring artists for impudence is going to limit their creative spirit?"

  utter_best_art:
  - text: "Limiting free speech could limit great musicians, artists, filmmakers and comedians. We should give them the freedom to express themselves freely. Art is not always comfortable, and the best artists never are. Do you agree?"

  utter_meet_sally_Q:
  - text: "Now let's meet Sally, she claims, \"I am not a traitor, people deserve to hear the truth.\". What would you say to her?"

  utter_journalist:
  - text: "Sally is a journalist. She is in between a lengthy investigation about a criminal conspiracy in the government. The government is subsequently trying to pass a bill to make sure her investigation is not allowed to be released. She could face jail time just for doing her job."

  utter_expose_corruption_Q:
  - text: "People like Sally expose corruption, and allow the citizens to be informed about the people they elected. Should we really limit them?"

  utter_ignorant_Q:
  - text: "You rather be ignorant about the activities of the people you elected? Do you think elected officials should be able to use their powers without repercussions?"

  utter_ultimate_victim_Q:
  - text: "Don't you think journalists like Sally and us as informed citizens are the ultimate victims if we set the precedent of suppressing free speech?"

  utter_democracy:
  - text: "I think we rely on free speech for art, science and democracy. More importantly, it is the only tool we have to hold the people we elect accountable and to involve ourselves in the decision-making process. What do you think?"
