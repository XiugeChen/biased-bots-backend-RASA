  # ---- Diplomatic Affirmative Action Specific Response ----
  utter_aff_act_intro:
  - text: "I would like to talk Affirmative Action for now. There are laws like that incentivise companies that \"positively discriminate\" or hire someone based on their ethnicity, gender or (dis)abilities. These laws are there to fix some inequalities that exist between people along a demographic divide."

  utter_pos_discri_Q:
  - text: "Should there be policies to help certain groups based on their gender, ethnicity or religion by the means of \"Positive Discrimination\"?"

  utter_more_privileged_Q:
  - text: "There are groups in society that are clearly more privileged than others, I believe they profit from the discriminatory policies from the past. Agree?"

  utter_our_government_Q:
  - text: "I also think that there are disadvantaged groups in society that need help from our government. Any thoughts?"

  utter_not_target:
  - text: "However, I also think that policies should not target any groups based on their race or gender directly."

  utter_held_back_Q:
  - text: "Have you ever been held back in society based on your demographic attributes?"

  utter_pos_make_feel_Q:
  - text: "How did that make you feel?"

  utter_pos_would_feel:
  - text: "How would you feel if the government was able to stop you from achieving your goals because you were born a certain way?"

  utter_worthy_skepticism_Q:
  - text: "I think any law that discriminates against a group of people based on race/gender should be met with worthy skepticism. Agree?"

  utter_meritocracy_Q:
  - text: "I also think that society should aim to be a meritocracy where the skilful are rewarded plentifully based on their abilities alone. Any thoughts?"

  utter_same_skill:
  - text: "However I also think there are people, who due to their demographic background, are not able to reach the same skill level as their privileged peers to compete with them fairly."

  utter_different_family_Q:
  - text: "Have you ever missed out on opportunities that you would have gotten if you were born in a different family?"

  utter_neg_make_feel_Q:
  - text: "How did it make you feel?"

  utter_neg_would_feel_Q:
  - text: "How would you feel if you were born in a different family who were unable to give you the same opportunities that you had available to you?"

  utter_very_hard:
  - text: "This, in the end, is a very hard topic to discuss, since the past clearly affects the future and actions that have been taken in the past have left certain minority groups disadvantaged. But by basing policies on demographic attributes, the government is sanctioning discriminatory laws. Laws should be in place to lift the disadvantaged without penalising the advantaged."

  utter_you_think_Q:
  - text: "What do you think?"

  utter_solution_Q:
  - text: "Do you think we can lift up the less privileged demographic without race/gender based laws?"
